## Session IDs
Each session of the Lucky Draw operates under a unique Session ID. This Session ID is used to distinguish between different draws and to ensure that participants are correctly registered for the correct draw. Here's what you need to know about Session IDs:

### Generation:
Session IDs are generated for each new session by the admin. Each ID is unique and only valid for one session.

### Use of Session ID: 
The Session ID is used throughout the Lucky Draw web app. It's embedded in the URL of all pages, including the registration page, the winner announcement page, and the QR code. This is how the app ensures that you're interacting with the correct session.

### QR Code and Session ID:
When you scan the QR code with your smartphone, it directs you to the registration page for a specific session. The URL you're directed to includes the Session ID, which automatically associates your registration with the correct session.

### Winner Announcement Page:
When you visit the winner announcement page, the URL should include the Session ID. This ensures that the page announces the winner for the correct session.

Please note, it's important not to manually alter the Session ID in the URL. If you encounter any issues related to Session ID, please contact our support team.
